# Password-Checker-UI
This project gives a simple interface to Pwned Password API service, where the user can friendly check if their passwords have been leaked such that they are able to be always safe. It uses Python Flask framework to handle the user's request as well as a script that ensures user's input encryption.
To install all Python's libraries that are necessary to run the project, use the pip install -r requirements.txt once you are in the same path the project is.The python -m venv venv command can also be used to create a virtual environment and execute the scripts without getting trouble with the versions of the same library you might have installed.
To do so, besides the command to create the environment given above, it's necessary to activate the script that is responsible for starting it. It may vary from platform to platform, nevertheless the commands are quite similar venv\scripts\activate.bat (Windows example).
